# 🧠 Image Classification with CNN | CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project demonstrates a complete deep learning pipeline using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** built with **Keras and TensorFlow** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10** dataset.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project includes the following key steps:

- 📥 **Dataset Loading and Exploration**: Utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, preloaded from TensorFlow — no manual download needed.
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
- 🔁 **Data Augmentation**: Applies real-time augmentation to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.
- 🧠 **CNN Model Building**: Multi-layered convolutional architecture with dropout and batch normalization.
- 🎯 **Model Training**: Trains the model with callbacks such as EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau for better control.
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation**: Analyzes accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and per-class performance using a classification report.
- 🔧 **Model Improvement**: Includes dynamic handling of overfitting/underfitting via regularization and architectural tuning.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Copy and paste the code from the `SentimentAnalysisWithCustomerReviewsAmazon.ipynb` (or respective file).
4. Run all cells in sequence.

## 🌟 Key Features

- ✅ **Built-in Dataset**: CIFAR-10 is directly accessed through TensorFlow datasets.
- ✅ **Well-structured Pipeline**: Cleanly divided sections for better readability and modularity.
- ✅ **Automatic Model Diagnosis**: Automatically adjusts techniques based on whether the model is overfitting or underfitting.
- ✅ **Visualization Tools**: Includes matplotlib-based plots for insights into performance and predictions.
- ✅ **Detailed Reporting**: Classification report and confusion matrix help analyze model strengths and weaknesses class-wise.
